Welcome to the Golden Mine Challenge, where your coding skills will lead you through a maze of gold-filled mines to uncover the most prosperous paths buried in the code. Are you ready to embark on this adventurous journey to become the ultimate gold digger of code? Let's dive into the details!

Challenge Overview
In a land far away, there lies a gold mine of dimensions **n*m**, a treasure trove that beckons the brave. Each field in this mine is brimming with gold, measured in tons, just waiting to be claimed. But here's the catch - the mine is enchanted with a spell that allows movement in a peculiar fashion.

As a daring miner, you start your journey in the first column of the mine, with the freedom to begin at any row of your choosing. Your quest is to navigate through the mine, collecting as much gold as possible in as fast as you can. However, you can only move in three specific directions:

**ü°¢ Right**
**ü°• Right-Up Diagonal**
**ü°¶ Right-Down Diagonal**
Your challenge is to find the maximum amount of gold you can collect by traversing the mine from the first column to the last, making strategic moves that will lead you to the wealthiest path.

**Code Output**<br>
The output of you solution should be an integer that returns the number of the most gold, highest value
